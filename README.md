1. Selecting AWS Product(s) for Hosting:
For hosting the Flask backend application, I recommend utilizing AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Here's the justification for this choice:

- Cost: Elastic Beanstalk offers a managed service with no upfront costs. You pay only for the AWS resources used to store and run your application. It provides a cost-effective solution compared to managing EC2 instances directly.
- Scalability: Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto-scaling of the application. This ensures that the application can scale seamlessly in response to varying levels of traffic without any manual intervention.
- Ease of Maintenance: Elastic Beanstalk abstracts away the underlying infrastructure management, allowing developers to focus solely on the application code. It simplifies deployment, monitoring, and scaling tasks, reducing the operational overhead.


2. Data Storage Strategy:
For storing the data generated by the application, I recommend using Amazon DynamoDB. Here's the justification for this choice:

- Real-time Data Storage: DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. It is well-suited for storing real-time data points generated by the application every 30 minutes.
- Scalability: DynamoDB automatically scales to accommodate growing workloads and can handle millions of requests per second. It ensures that the application can scale seamlessly as the volume of data increases over time.
- Data Retrieval: DynamoDB allows for efficient retrieval of both the latest data and historical records. By using appropriate partition keys and sort keys, we can retrieve the latest data points quickly while still maintaining a history of previous data points.


3. API Endpoints Design:
I propose designing a single endpoint for all data points in one JSON file. Here's the rationale for this choice:

- Simplicity: A single endpoint reduces the complexity of the API and simplifies client-side integration. Clients can retrieve all data points with a single API call, streamlining the process.
- Efficiency: By returning all data points in a single JSON file, we minimize the number of HTTP requests required to fetch the data. This improves performance and reduces network overhead.
- Accessing Latest Data: To access the latest data, the application can query DynamoDB using appropriate sort keys to retrieve the most recent data points. This ensures that clients always receive up-to-date information.



4. Server Uptime Solution:
To ensure server uptime with minimal downtime, we can implement the following strategies leveraging AWS features and best practices:

- Auto Scaling: Configure Elastic Beanstalk to automatically scale the application based on traffic patterns. This ensures that the application can handle fluctuations in demand without experiencing downtime.
- Multi-AZ Deployment: Deploy the application across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to increase fault tolerance. In the event of an AZ failure, traffic is automatically routed to healthy instances in other AZs, minimizing downtime.
- Continuous Monitoring: Utilize AWS CloudWatch to monitor the health and performance of the application. Set up alarms to notify administrators of any issues or performance degradation, allowing for proactive intervention.
- Regular Backups: Implement regular backups of DynamoDB data to prevent data loss in case of accidental deletion or corruption. Utilize AWS Backup or custom scripts to automate the backup process and ensure data durability.

By following these strategies, we can maintain high availability and reliability for the Flask backend application hosted on AWS, ensuring a seamless experience for users and minimizing downtime.
